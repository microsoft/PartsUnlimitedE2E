# How to contribute

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions and discuss issues. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes.

## General feedback, discussions, bugs, feature requests

Please start a discussion or log a new issue on the [Home repo issue tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited/issues).

## Filing issues

When filing issues, please consider using this sample [bug filing template](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Functional-bug-template) from the ASP.Net team.
The best way to get your bug fixed is to be as detailed as you can be about the problem.
Providing steps to reproduce the problem is ideal.
Here are questions you can answer before you file a bug to make sure you're not missing any important information.

1. Did you read the [documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited/tree/master/docs)?
2. Did you include the snippet of broken code in the issue?
3. What are the *EXACT* steps to reproduce this problem?
4. What package versions are you using (you can see these in the `project.json` file)?
5. What operating system are you using?
6. What version of Visual Studio are you using?

GitHub supports [markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/), so when filing bugs make sure you check the formatting before clicking submit.
